## Example Filled Script

### Opening

So, here's the situation. Andrew called about joining Synthius, a mental health platform for builders.

Should I commit my time to this right now?

<pause length="medium"/>

### The Tension

The thing is, I'm launching Salience in February. Every hour I give Synthius is an hour not spent on my own launch.

<sigh> It's not straightforward.

### First Principles Reality Check

Let me be honest. I already have Claude Code, my own MCP servers, Obsidian. I can build agent memory myself. Synthius doesn't solve something I genuinely can't do.

<pause length="short"/>

### The Numbers

Here's what the analysis shows:

If I give three hours a week for six weeks, that's eighteen hours. At my rate, that's about two thousand seven hundred euros worth of time.

That's roughly two Salience course modules I won't be building.

<pause length="short"/>

### What Could Go Wrong

Now for the uncomfortable part.

In September, Andrew had six to eleven potential co-founders. Now it's just him and Artem. Eighty percent attrition in four months.

The analysis suggests a seventy-five percent probability of zero or negative return.

<pause length="medium"/>

### The Biases

And here's where I need to be really honest with myself.

I'm feeling FOMO. I'm feeling sunk cost from those previous meetings. I'm influenced by the "tier zero point three investors" mention. <sigh> Classic authority bias.

<pause length="short"/>

### The Verdict

<pause length="medium"/>

My recommendation? <emphasis>Observe only.</emphasis>

Take the Monday call. Maximum three hours per week. No builder commitment until Salience launches.

"I'm launching Salience in February. Until then, I can offer maximum three hours per week for observation. If that doesn't work, let's reconnect in March."

<chuckle> Sometimes the best decision is no decision. Yet.

## Usage Notes

1. **Customize placeholders**: Replace {{VARIABLE}} with decision-specific content
2. **Match emotional beats**: Place `<sigh>` at genuine concern points, `<chuckle>` for self-awareness
3. **Use pauses strategically**: Before key revelations, after heavy information
4. **Keep it conversational**: Write for the ear, not the eye
5. **Duration target**: 2-3 minutes spoken (roughly 350-500 words)
